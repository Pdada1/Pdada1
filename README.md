## About Me
A second-year Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. Iâ€™m passionate about developing efficient ways to broaden our use of space, especially outside of lower earth orbit. At Waterloo, Iâ€™m a member of the Waterloo Rocketry Team, currently working to more efficiently mount recovery electronic PCBs, as well as improve the teamâ€™s ground data display system. On the side, I love to read (highly recommend The Anthropocene Reviewed by John Green), take photos, and ski . Feel free to reach out about emerging space technologies, books, or just to chat.
